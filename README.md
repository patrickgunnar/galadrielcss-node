# Galadriel CSS

## Introduction to Galadriel CSS

Galadriel CSS is a groundbreaking framework designed to revolutionize how developers manage styles in scalable applications. By employing a modular, context-centric architecture, it offers unparalleled flexibility, efficiency, and maintainability. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks, Galadriel CSS emphasizes clean development practices, ensuring a pristine codebase while enabling effortless scaling and adaptability.

## Why Galadriel CSS?

The motivation behind creating Galadriel CSS stems from the challenges faced with traditional CSS methodologies and frameworks as applications grow in complexity. Issues like codebase pollution, CSS bloat, and maintenance difficulties often arise, making scalability a daunting task. Galadriel CSS addresses these problems with a unique approach:

-   **Modular and Contextual Design**: Styles are defined and applied within a well-structured context hierarchy, ensuring precision and isolation.
-   **Clean Development Codebase**: With its domain-specific language (DSL), Nenyr, Galadriel CSS eliminates the clutter caused by utility classes in development.
-   **Effortless Scalability**: The framework ensures that styles remain organized and extensible as your application grows.

## Objectives of Galadriel CSS

-   **Simplify Style Management**: Provide a systematic approach to defining, organizing, and applying styles.
-   **Enhance Scalability**: Support seamless growth of applications without compromising maintainability or performance.
-   **Promote Clean Code Practices**: Keep development codebases free from utility class clutter while maintaining efficient style application in production.
-   **Optimize Performance**: Generate minimal, utility-first CSS for faster load times and reduced redundancy.

## Benefits of Galadriel CSS

1. **Clean Development Codebase**:
   Work with declarative, context-specific syntax during development while utility classes are automatically generated during the build process.

2. **Scalability and Maintainability**:

    - **Context Hierarchy**: Organizes styles into Central, Layout, and Module Contexts for isolation and precision.
    - **Inheritance and Extension**: Reduces redundancy and promotes consistency across styles.

3. **Modular Architecture**: Ensures independence and cohesion, preventing style conflicts and enabling easy updates.

4. **Efficient and Optimized CSS**: Transforms Nenyr definitions into optimized utility-first CSS for performance gains.

## How Galadriel CSS Works

### Context Hierarchy

Galadriel CSS organizes styles into three primary contexts:

-   **Central Context**: Defines global styles and themes applied across the entire application.
-   **Layout Context**: Manages layout-specific styles for sections or groups of components.
-   **Module Context**: Encapsulates styles for individual components, ensuring isolation and reusability.

### Nenyr DSL

Nenyr, the DSL powering Galadriel CSS, enables developers to write clean, declarative style definitions during development. These are transformed into utility classes during the build process, ensuring efficient and maintainable styles.

### Inheritance and Extension

-   **Class Inheritance**: Enables child classes to inherit styles from parent classes for consistency.
-   **Context Extension**: Allows contexts to extend others, promoting modularity and reusability.

### Variable and Animation Uniqueness

Variables and animations are scoped to their respective contexts, preventing conflicts and ensuring precise application.

## The Galadriel CSS Advantage

-   **Clean Development**: Declarative syntax without utility class clutter.
-   **Easy to Scale**: Modular and context-driven architecture for seamless growth.
-   **Maintainable**: Simplified updates through context inheritance and extension.
-   **Performance-Optimized**: Minimal CSS output for faster load times.

## Installing Galadriel CSS with the Integration Client

### Global Installation

Galadriel CSS uses a global installation model to streamline the setup process, making it accessible across multiple projects. To install Galadriel CSS globally, run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g galadrielcss
```

### Project Setup

After global installation, setting up a new project with Galadriel CSS is straightforward:

1. Initialize your project as usual (e.g., using `npm init` or `yarn init`).
2. Install the integration client specific to your framework or bundler. For example:
    ```bash
    npm install @galadrielcss/webpack
    ```
3. Configure the integration client to connect with the Galadriel CSS runtime. Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/patrickgunnar/galadrielcss) for detailed configuration steps.

### Development Workflow

1. Define your styles using Nenyr within your project's components.
2. Run your development server; the integration client will automatically process and inject styles into your application.
3. Build your project for production; Galadriel CSS will generate optimized, utility-first CSS for deployment.
